To run my colab, simply execute all blocks on colab

Kaggle public: 0.78806

Disclaimer: This homework is somewhat random. I pass the public boss baseline when executing on colab but do not pass the public boss baseline when I run the same code on my computer, i.e., different machines may yield different result
